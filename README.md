## Values

### Constants and Variables

- ```swift
    // Declaring a constant
    let placeOfBirth = "New Jersey"

    // Declaring a variable
    var currentLocation = "New Jersey"

    // Assigning a new value to a variable
    currentLocation = "California"
  ```

- In most ways, constants and variables are the same:
  - Both use the same rules for names
  - Both associate a name with an assigned value
  - Both have a specific type
- The difference is:
  - The value of a constant cannot be changed after it's first assigned.
  - The value of a variable can be changed after it's first assigned.
- Values declared with let are constants, and canâ€™t be changed once a value is assigned. These values are called immutable.
- Values declared with var are variables, and can be assigned new values over time. These values are called mutable.
- A mutable value can be used as part of an assignment statement to itself: score = score + 10.
- Compound assignment operators allow mutable values to be updated: score += 10.
- Using constants and variables in the correct places helps make your code safer and easier to understand.
- Error Indicator
  - The normal error indicator is a red circle with a white x in it.
  - But an error indicator having an idea how to fix the error on Xcode is a red circle with a white dot in it.
    - a Fix-it will fix errors in your code, but the fix might not be what you meant to do.
    - The Fix-it is trying to be helpful, but it could be suggesting that you make something mutable that you wanted to stay immutable.
