## Values

### Constants and Variables

- ```swift
    // Declaring a constant
    let placeOfBirth = "New Jersey"

    // Declaring a variable
    var currentLocation = "New Jersey"

    // Assigning a new value to a variable
    currentLocation = "California"
  ```

- In most ways, constants and variables are the same:
  - Both use the same rules for names
  - Both associate a name with an assigned value
  - Both have a specific type
- The difference is:
  - The value of a constant cannot be changed after it's first assigned.
  - The value of a variable can be changed after it's first assigned.
- Values declared with let are constants, and canâ€™t be changed once a value is assigned. These values are called immutable.
- Values declared with var are variables, and can be assigned new values over time. These values are called mutable.
- A mutable value can be used as part of an assignment statement to itself: score = score + 10.
- Compound assignment operators allow mutable values to be updated: score += 10.
- Using constants and variables in the correct places helps make your code safer and easier to understand.
- Error Indicator
  - The normal error indicator is a red circle with a white x in it.
  - But an error indicator having an idea how to fix the error on Xcode is a red circle with a white dot in it.
    - a Fix-it will fix errors in your code, but the fix might not be what you meant to do.
    - The Fix-it is trying to be helpful, but it could be suggesting that you make something mutable that you wanted to stay immutable.
- special string syntax for long text

  - ```swift
      let manyLineString =
      """
      This is a long string.
      It can be interpolated \(1) or any number of times. You don't have to escape "quote marks."

      And it can contain empty lines, like the one above.
      Just use three quotes on their own lines to open and close it.
      """
    ```

### Build a PhotoFrame App

1. Create a new Xcode project.
   1. iOS section > App > Next
   2. Product Name: PhotoFrame, Interface: Storyboard, Language: Swift > Next
   3. Select a location to save > Create
2. The simulator may appear large on your screen. You can make it smaller by choosing Window > Physical Size.
3. Xcode Workspace
   - <img src="./resources/images/xcode_workspace.png" alt="Xcode Workspace" width="400" />
   - Toolbar
     - To check the project's status
     - To hide and show the other window areas
     - To build and run your app from the big "Play" button
   - Navigator
     - To move around your project; select file to open in the editor by clicking it
   - Editor
     - To edit your project files; source code, user interface items, or app configuration
   - Inspector
     - To find out more details about the item currently selected or displayed in the editor
     - Especially to edit user interface files in Interface Builder
